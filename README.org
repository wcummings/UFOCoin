** What (barely) works

   - [X] Peer discovery
   - [X] Mining empty blocks
   - [X] Append-only block store + indices
   - [X] Block propagation/validation
   - [X] UPnP
   - [ ] Key management
   - [ ] TX signing etc.
   - [ ] Everything else

** Building

Build w/ mix:

#+begin_src bash
mix release --env=prod
#+end_src

Currently everything is configured through configs.exs.

** Docker

I've included docker and docker-compose configs, so you can run a testnet locally. The compose config will spin up 6 identical
instances, one which matches an address in my test seed DNS: test1.wpc.io. If you don't modify the seed DNS you risk getting
some bad peers but it shouldn't really matter if they cross-polinate, your nodes might just take longer to connect.

#+begin_src bash
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up
#+end_src
